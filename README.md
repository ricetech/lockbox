# lockbox

lockbox is a package logistics service designed to reduce the time and hassle spent dealing with receiving packages. Users send packages to lockbox instead of their home address, where they are held until lockbox delivers the package during a timeslot of the user's choice, preventing 'missed delivery notices' that force people to go out of their way to go to the post office to get their package.
