	<h1>WHAT LOCKBOX HAS TO OFFER</h1>
	<p class="features-intro">
		Have you ever had to block out  a whole day to wait for a single package? 
		Whether it’s coming home early from work or cancelling plans for a delivery in 
		fear of it getting stolen and/or having to travel distances to the post office. 
		This is a very big inconvenience you shouldn't be worrying about. Lockbox is a 
		delivering-service that keeps your packages safe by allowing users to customize 
		their delivery time and make sure they are home for their package.
