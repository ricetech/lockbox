	<h1>WHAT LOCKBOX OFFERS</h1>
	<p>
		Have you ever had to block out  a whole day to wait for a single package? 
		Whether it’s coming home early from work or cancelling plans for a delivery in 
		fear of it getting stolen and/or having to travel distances to the post office. 
		This is a very big inconvenience you shouldn't be worrying about. Lockbox is a 
		delivering-service that keeps your packages safe by allowing users to customize 
		their delivery time and make sure they are home for their package.
		</p>

	<h2>CONVENIENT</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Lockbox stores your packages until you’re ready for it. </li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>TIME SAVING</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>You tell us when you want your package, and it shows up at your door.</li>
		<li>One hour timeframe, which is much more reasonable than the 12-14 hours. </li>
		<li>Lockbox stores your packages until you’re ready for it.	</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>AFFORDABLE</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>You only pay for what you use - no subscription fee. </li>
		<li>Discounts if you take an off-peak delivery slot. </li>
		<li>An option to restrict social media apps and/ or games during work hours, allow users to be more efficient in their work life by eliminating distractions. </li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Compensation if we miss the window. </li>
	</ul>
