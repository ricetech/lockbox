	<h2>What is lockbox?</h2>
	<p>Chameleon is an adaptive launcher for Android devices that allows you to have a personalized home screen that forms around your personal needs and usage style.</p>
	<h2>Why lockbox?</h2>
	<p>Most Android home screens are static. They don't change without the user intervening. Chameleon Launcher takes your boring, changeless home screen and transforms it into an adaptive launcher that shows you only your most important apps depending on the time of day and how you use it, making it easier to get to what you need, faster.</p>
	<h2>Download Chameleon</h2>
	<p>Available on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps">Google Play Store</a></p>
